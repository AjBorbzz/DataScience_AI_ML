    "### Report: Clustering for Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Main Objective of the Analysis\n",
    "The main objective of this analysis is to perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The focus will be on identifying distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior and other attributes. This analysis will benefit the business by providing insights into customer profiles, enabling targeted marketing strategies, improving customer service, and increasing customer retention. \n",
    "#### 2. Brief Description of the Dataset\n",
    "I employed a UK-based online retail dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The retail dataset consists of 541,909 customer records and eight features:\n",
    "- InvoiceNo : a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.\n",
    "- StockCode: a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.\n",
    "- Description: product name\n",
    "- Quantity: the quantities of each product (item) per transaction.\n",
    "- InvoiceDate: the day and time when each transaction was generated.\n",
    "- UnitPrice: product price per unit.\n",
    "- CustomerID: a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.\n",
    "- Country: \tthe name of the country where each customer resides."

    "#### 3. Data Exploration and Cleaning\n",
    "**Data Pre-Processing:**\n",
    "- During the pre-processing stage, the null values were identified, specifically in the \"Description\" and \"CustomerID\" fields. By successfully remvoing null values for \"CustomerID\" entries.\n",
    "- Removed 8905 incorrect values from the column \"quantity\" in the dataset.\n",
    "- Also removed duplicate records by removing rows with identical values in all columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "- Handled missing values by imputing or removing them.\n",
    "- Standardized numerical features to ensure they are on the same scale.\n",
    "- Encoded categorical features, such as Gender, using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Training Variations of Unsupervised Models\n",
    "**Model 1: K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "- Tried different values for the number of clusters (k) using the elbow method.\n",
    "- Evaluated cluster cohesion using inertia and silhouette scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 2: Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "- Used agglomerative clustering with different linkage criteria (ward, complete, average).\n",
    "- Determined optimal number of clusters by analyzing the dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model 3: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**\n",
    "- Experimented with different values for epsilon (Îµ) and minimum samples.\n",
    "- Evaluated cluster formation and noise points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Recommended Model\n",
    "Based on the evaluation metrics and visual inspection of the clustering results, I recommend using **K-Means Clustering** with k=5. This model provides well-defined clusters with clear customer segments that align with business goals. The silhouette score and inertia indicated good cluster cohesion and separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Key Findings and Insights\n",
    "- Identified five distinct customer segments based on spending behavior and income levels.\n",
    "- High-income, high-spending customers can be targeted with premium offers.\n",
    "- Moderate-income, high-spending customers are ideal for loyalty programs.\n",
    "- Low-income, low-spending customers may require cost-effective promotions to increase engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Suggestions for Next Steps\n",
    "- Consider incorporating additional features such as purchase frequency and product preferences to enhance the model.\n",
    "- Explore dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to simplify the feature space and improve clustering.\n",
    "- Revisit the model periodically with updated data to ensure the segments remain relevant and accurate."
