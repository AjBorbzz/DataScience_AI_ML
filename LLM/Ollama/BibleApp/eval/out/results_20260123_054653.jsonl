It encourages us to trust in His sovereignty and seek wisdom from Him.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Isaiah 41:21-25 — \"Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob... Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.\"\n* Job 11:6-10 — \"Canst thou by searching find out God?

Jesus promises to prepare a place for us and receive us unto Himself, giving us the assurance of eternal life (John 14:1-5). When we face big decisions, we can call upon God and seek His wisdom, knowing that He will save us and guide us (Psalms 55:16-20).\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Seek God's guidance through prayer and meditation.\n* Trust in His sovereignty and wisdom, rather than trying to figure everything out on your own.\n* Bring your concerns before Him, declaring the things that are to come.\n* Remember that you cannot fully understand or find out God through searching alone; instead, trust in His guidance and provision.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your guidance and wisdom.
