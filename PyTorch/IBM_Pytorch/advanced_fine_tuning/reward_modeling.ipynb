    "# Reward Modeling\n",
    "reward modeling is the process of training a model to evaluate and score the outputs of a large language model (LLM) based on how well they align with desired behaviors, goals, or values. This score is then used to fine-tune the LLM so that it produces better responses in line with those objectives."

    "### The Dataset\n",
    "the `Dahoas/synthetic-instruct-gptj-pairwise` data set from Hugging Face, a synthetic data set that is designed for training and evaluating instruction-following models. This data set includes pairs of prompts and responses, where one response is preferred over the other. The primary use case is to train models to distinguish between better and worse responses, essential for tasks like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set helps train models for better understanding and following instructions by learning from pairs of good and bad responses. This is particularly useful for improving the quality of generated responses in dialogue systems and other AI applications that require understanding and generating natural language instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning**: Enhancing models to prefer better responses based on feedback\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning language models**: Improving the performance of models on instruction-following tasks\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Assessing the ability of models to distinguish between high- and low-quality responses"

Generally, a full-bodied red wine like Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah is a good choice, as its bold flavors can stand up to the rich flavors of the steak. Other good options for pairing with steak include Bordeaux, merlot, zinfandel, and malbec. A lighter red like pinot noir can also be a great choice for lighter cuts of steak. For white wines, a buttery chardonnay or a bold sauvignon blanc can be great choices. A sparkling wine, such as Prosecco, can also go well with steak. \n",

You can also make a chandoull paste, and that is somewhat similar.  There’s lots of stuff in a pan that goes on top of the sauce, such as gravy-shaped pieces.

That mixture is called a roux, and it is a combination of cooked vegetable fragments, mixed with the stock.
