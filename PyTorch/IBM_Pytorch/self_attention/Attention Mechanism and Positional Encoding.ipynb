    "\n",
    "After completing this lab you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basics of tokenization and how textual data is prepared for neural network models.\n",
    "- Learn the concept of one-hot encoding and its application in representing textual data for machine learning models.\n",
    "- Explore the self-attention mechanism, a key component of Transformer models, which allows the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence for making predictions.\n",
    "- Implement a basic self-attention mechanism and integrate it into a neural network model.\n",
    "- Grasp the importance of positional encoding in Transformer models, providing the model with the necessary information about the order of words in a sentence.\n",
    "- Implement positional encoding and observe its effect on model performance and understanding of sequence order.\n",
    "- Apply the learned concepts to build a simple translation model or text processing task, demonstrating the practical application of self-attention and positional encoding.\n",
    "- Develop an intuition for the workings of modern NLP models, particularly the Transformer architecture, and understand their advantages over traditional sequence processing models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n",
    "- Encourage further exploration and experimentation with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and applications in natural language processing.\n"

    "- [`torch.nn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html), [`torch.nn.functional`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html): These PyTorch submodules are used to define the neural network layers and apply functions such as activations, which are essential in building the model architecture.\n",
    "- [`Levenshtein`](https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/): This library is used for calculating the Levenshtein distance, which can be useful for evaluating model performance in tasks like text generation or translation by measuring the difference between the predicted and actual text sequences.\n",
    "- [`get_tokenizer`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/data_utils.html), [`build_vocab_from_iterator`](https://pytorch.org/text/stable/vocab.html) from `torchtext`: These functions are crucial for preprocessing text data, including tokenizing text into words or subwords and building a vocabulary from the dataset, which are foundational steps in preparing data for NLP models.\n"

These tensors can be thought of as a look-up table that our model will use to associate input tokens with output tokens.\n",

This process mimics the lookup the you would perform in an actual neural network during translation tasks.\n",

It is a binary tensor with the same shape as the input sequence. A value of 1 indicates that attention is allowed, while a value of 0 indicates that attention should be disregarded. This mask is particularly useful when working with triangular attention masks, where each position in the sequence can only attend to previous positions.\n",

It is a binary tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length). A value of 1 indicates that the corresponding position contains a valid token, while a value of 0 indicates that the position contains a padding token. By providing this mask, the attention mechanism can ignore padding tokens and focus only on the meaningful parts of the input sequence. This parameter is particularly useful when dealing with variable-length sequences that have been padded to a fixed length.\n"
