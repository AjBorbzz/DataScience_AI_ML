# Ollama exploration
I am exploring Ollama with LiteLLM. I will be posting projects ranging from simple to usable implementations to tackle AI advancements and showcase my skills in creatively developing solutions for future employers. I am currently exploring this field and hoping to transition from Security Automation Engineer to AI/ML Engineer, and I hope that these repositories help showcase what I have to offer. I am continuously learning and exploring these trends to keep up with the pace of software development that utilizes AI/ML and other advanced or futuristic tools.
