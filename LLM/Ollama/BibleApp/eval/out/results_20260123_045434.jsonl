It also emphasizes the importance of being good stewards of our resources, using them wisely and not accumulating wealth at the expense of others.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Isaiah 55:1-5 — \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price... Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\"\n* Luke 16:1-5 — \"And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods... And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible teaches us that God is our ultimate provider, and we should trust in Him for our financial needs. Isaiah 55:1-5 reminds us that God offers spiritual nourishment without cost or condition, and that we should come to Him with an open heart and mind. Luke 16:1-5 tells the story of a steward who was accused of wasting his master's goods. The steward realized he couldn't continue in his role and began to make plans for his future, including seeking help from his lord's debtors.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Trust God as your ultimate provider, rather than relying on your paycheck.\n* Use your resources wisely, avoiding waste and excess.\n* Seek guidance from Scripture and prayer when making financial decisions.\n* Consider sharing your resources with others in need, rather than accumulating wealth at their expense.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Lord, we thank you for being our ultimate provider.

What guidance does Scripture give about borrowing?", "allowed_refs": ["Romans 8:11-15", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10", "Matthew 6:11-15", "John 8:31-35", "Matthew 18:31-35"], "found_refs": ["Romans 8:11-15", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10"], "invalid_refs": [], "citation_valid": 1, "format_valid": 1, "groundedness": 0.8571428571428571, "answer": "Biblical Summary:\nScripture teaches that debt can be a serious issue and may even lead to spiritual consequences. The Bible provides guidance on borrowing and debt, emphasizing the importance of living responsibly and wisely with one's resources.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Romans 8:11-15 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.\n* Proverbs 22:26-29 — Be thou not one of them that strike hands, [Or] of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?\n* Deuteronomy 24:6-10 — No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible warns against getting into debt and becoming a surety for someone else's debts. Proverbs 22:26-29 cautions against striking hands or becoming a guarantor for loans, as this can lead to financial ruin and even loss of one's bed (home). Deuteronomy 24:6-10 prohibits taking a millstone or upper millstone as collateral, recognizing that debt can be a life-threatening issue.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Be mindful of your financial situation and avoid getting into debt whenever possible.\n* Consider the potential consequences of borrowing and ensure you have a plan to repay any loans.\n* Prioritize living within your means and building up your resources rather than relying on debt.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, we pray that You would guide us in our financial decisions and help us to live wisely with our resources. May we avoid the pitfalls of debt and instead build up our lives for Your glory. Amen."}

They change the night into day: The light, [say they], is near unto the darkness. If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness; If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister; Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?\n* Matthew 6:31-34 — Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n\nExplanation:\nIn Job 17:11-15, Job laments about his uncertain future, wondering where his hope lies. He is tempted to give up and accept death as his fate. However, this passage highlights the futility of seeking answers in darkness and despair. Instead, we should trust in God's sovereignty and provision.\n\nMatthew 6:31-34 teaches us not to worry about our daily needs, but rather seek God's kingdom and righteousness first. Our heavenly Father knows what we need, and He will provide for us. This passage encourages us to focus on eternal things rather than temporal concerns.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Practice trust in God's sovereignty by acknowledging His control over all aspects of life.\n* Seek God's kingdom and righteousness above material needs and desires.\n* Focus on eternal things, such as building a relationship with God and serving others, rather than worrying about the future.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to trust in Your sovereignty and provision.

My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.\n* Job 27:1-5 — And Job again took up his parable, and said, As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul: (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils); Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit. Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.\n* Psalms 26:1-5 — [[ A Psalm] of David]. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering. Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible emphasizes the importance of walking in integrity at work. Job, a righteous man who suffered greatly, refused to compromise his values and principles even when faced with adversity. He declared that he would not put away his integrity from him until he died (Job 27:5). Similarly, David, a king of Israel, trusted in God without wavering and walked in integrity, seeking to be examined and proven by God (Psalms 26:1-5).\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Recognize that your work is an opportunity to serve God and demonstrate your trust in Him.\n* Walk in integrity at work, refusing to compromise your values and principles for the sake of a paycheck or promotion.\n* Seek to be examined and proven by God, trusting that He will guide you and give you wisdom.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help me to walk in integrity at my job, trusting in You without wavering.

The Bible teaches us that forgiveness is not only a command but also a process that requires effort and intentionality.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* 2 Corinthians 2:6-10 — Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many; so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.\n* Matthew 18:31-35 — So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.\n* Ephesians 4:31-32 — Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.\n* Matthew 26:46-50 — Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible teaches us that forgiveness is not a natural response but rather a supernatural act of the heart.

This passage underscores the importance of living a life characterized by love and compassion towards others.\n\nMatthew 26:46-50 provides a poignant example of Jesus' willingness to forgive even in the face of betrayal. As we follow His example, we can learn to forgive without being naive.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Recognize that forgiveness is not a feeling but an act of obedience to God's command.\n* Understand that forgiveness does not mean forgetting or excusing the offense; rather, it means releasing the emotional burden associated with the hurt.\n* Practice self-reflection and prayer to process your emotions and seek guidance from the Holy Spirit.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to understand the importance of forgiveness in our lives. May we learn to forgive others as You have forgiven us, and may Your love and compassion guide us on this journey. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen."}
