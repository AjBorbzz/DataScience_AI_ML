He did not let his circumstances dictate his emotions or actions; instead, he trusted in God's sovereignty and provision.

Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.\n\nExplanation:\n(1 Samuel 3:6-10) In this passage, we see that God is calling Samuel to obedience from the heart. Eli's response, \"I called not, my son; lie down again,\" shows that true obedience requires a willingness to listen and respond to God's voice. This is not just about following rules or rituals but about surrendering our will to His.\n\n(Job 13:11-15) In Job's lamentation, we see the importance of trusting in God's goodness despite our circumstances.

Just as the glory of God is to conceal a thing, so too must we be cautious in seeking counsel from others. We must take away the dross (impurities) from the silver (counsel), and only then can we expect to receive a vessel for the refiner (wisdom). This process requires patience, diligence, and a willingness to listen.\n\n(Acts 1:11-15) The early church provides an example of seeking counsel wisely. After Jesus' ascension, the disciples returned to Jerusalem and devoted themselves to prayer, seeking guidance from God. They did not rush into action or seek counsel from just anyone; instead, they sought the Lord's direction through prayer.\n\nExplanation (continued): (Mark 3:16-20)\n(Job 13:11-15) Furthermore, the Bible teaches that we must be willing to listen to God's voice, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable. Job's words serve as a reminder that seeking counsel wisely requires humility and a willingness to submit to God's will.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n1. Take time to pray and seek God's guidance before making important decisions. (Mark 3:16-20)\n2.

The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\n- Romans 10:16-20 — But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? So belief [cometh] of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\n\nExplanation:\n(John 11:46-50) The Pharisees' fear of losing their power and influence is a classic example of how personal failure can lead to identity crisis. However, Jesus' teachings emphasize that true identity comes from dependence on God, not human achievements.\n(Romans 10:16-20) Isaiah's prophecy highlights the importance of hearing and believing the word of Christ for one's salvation.
