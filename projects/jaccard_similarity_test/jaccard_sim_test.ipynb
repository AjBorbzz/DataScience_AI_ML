    "# Jaccard Similarity\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore the significance of Jaccard similarity as a metric for assessing document similarity. Jaccard similarity measures the degree of overlap between two sets by comparing the size of their intersection to that of their union. This characteristic makes it particularly useful for analyzing textual data, where the focus is on the presence or absence of unique words rather than their frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing Jaccard similarity, we can effectively identify how closely related two documents are, making it an essential tool in applications such as plagiarism detection, content recommendation, and information retrieval. This notebook demonstrates how to compute Jaccard similarity using Python and scikit-learn, allowing us to quantify document similarity in a straightforward and interpretable manner."
