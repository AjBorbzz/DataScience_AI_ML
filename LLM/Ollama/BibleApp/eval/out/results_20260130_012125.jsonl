The Bible encourages us to seek guidance from others who have walked through similar struggles.

When we're faced with doubts and fears, it's crucial to quiet our hearts and minds before God.

What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?\n\nExplanation:\n(Romans 3:26-30) Genuine faith is demonstrated by trusting in God's righteousness and justifying the believer through Jesus Christ.

Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.\n- Psalms 112:6-10 — For he shall never be moved; The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible teaches that saving and trusting God daily are two distinct yet interconnected concepts. Saving refers to the act of setting aside or storing up treasures for oneself (Luke 12:21-25). This can include physical possessions, emotional security, or even spiritual achievements. On the other hand, trusting God daily means placing one's faith and reliance on Him, acknowledging His sovereignty, and surrendering one's life to His will.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n- Recognize that saving and trusting God are not mutually exclusive; rather, they complement each other. When we save for ourselves, we may be tempted to rely on our own resources and abilities, which can lead to anxiety and fear. However, when we trust God daily, we acknowledge that He is the ultimate provider and sustainer of life. (Matthew 5:31-35)\n- Practice trusting God daily by surrendering your plans, desires, and fears to Him.

However, it presents various perspectives and examples that can help us understand this mystery.

So Job died, being old and full of days.\n- Job 1:21-22 — Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.

This does not mean we will understand why we are suffering, but it allows us to maintain a right relationship with God.

And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.\n- Luke 6:11-15 — And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles...\n\nExplanation:\n(John 10:41-42) Jesus' ministry was marked by suffering, rejection, and ultimately, death. Yet, this suffering did not hinder His spiritual growth or the growth of those around Him. In fact, it was through these trials that He glorified God (John 11:46-50).\n\n(Acts 1:11-15) The apostles, who had walked with Jesus during His ministry, continued to pray and seek guidance after His ascension. This perseverance in prayer was a testament to their spiritual growth and maturity.\n\nExplanation:\n(Luke 7:16-20) John the Baptist's disciples asked Jesus if He was the Messiah or if they should look for another. Jesus' response was not about avoiding suffering, but rather about persevering through it. His followers were called to continue in prayer and seek guidance from Him (Acts 1:11-15).\n\nWisdom Applications:\n(John 13:36-38) As we face suffering, we must be willing to lay down our lives for Jesus, just as Peter was willing to do.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.\n\nExplanation:\n(2 Timothy 4:11-15) As we see in the passage from 2 Timothy, obedience to God's will can be costly. Paul is willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the gospel, even when it means leaving behind those who are dear to him. Similarly, Jesus calls us to lay down our lives for Him, just as He laid down His life for us.\n(John 13:36-38) Peter's willingness to die for Jesus is admirable, but Jesus knows that Peter will ultimately deny Him three times before the cock crows. This passage highlights the importance of obedience, even when it seems costly or difficult.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n- (<AllowedRef>) When faced with a decision that requires obedience to God's will, ask yourself if you are willing to make sacrifices for His sake.
