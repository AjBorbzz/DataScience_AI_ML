This understanding can bring us peace and confidence, even in the midst of turmoil.\n(Psalms 11:1-5) When we feel overwhelmed by the wickedness around us, we must take refuge in God alone. He is our stronghold, our protector, and our hope.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n- Trust in God's sovereignty and provision, just as Paul did as a Roman citizen (Acts 22:26-30).\n- Seek refuge in God's presence, rather than trying to control or manipulate circumstances (Psalms 11:1-5).\n\n(Optional) Closing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, we come to you today with hearts filled with worry and uncertainty.

However, the Bible teaches us that forgiveness is not only a moral imperative but also a means of releasing ourselves from the negative emotions associated with holding onto resentment.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n- Ezekiel 20:41-45 — As a sweet savor will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.\n- 1 Corinthians 7:11-15 — For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.\n\nExplanation:\n(Ezekiel 20:41-45) In this passage, God promises to accept His people when He brings them out of their exile. This acceptance is not based on their good deeds or lack thereof, but rather on God's desire to sanctify Himself in their midst. Similarly, when we forgive those who have wronged us, we are not doing so because they deserve it, but rather because we want to be like God and demonstrate His character.\n(1 Corinthians 7:11-15) In this passage, Paul teaches that even unbelieving spouses can be sanctified through their relationship with a believing partner. This is not to say that the unbeliever's actions are justified or excused, but rather that they can still be influenced by the believer's faith and become holy.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n(Ezekiel 20:41-45) When we choose to forgive those who have wronged us, we are not condoning their behavior. Rather, we are choosing to release ourselves from the negative emotions associated with holding onto resentment.\n(1 Corinthians 7:11-15) Just as an unbelieving spouse can be sanctified through their relationship with a believing partner, so too can our relationships with others be transformed when we choose to forgive and release the past.\n\n(Optional) Closing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to understand that forgiveness is not about condoning wrong behavior, but rather about releasing ourselves from the negative emotions associated with holding onto resentment. May we choose to follow Your example and demonstrate Your character by forgiving those who have wronged us. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen."}
