# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Prediction project! In this hands-on project, we will build a Logistic Regression classifier to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following tasks:

1. **Introduction and Import Libraries**: Get started by importing the necessary libraries and understanding the project objectives.
2. **Download dataset directly from Kaggle**: Learn how to download the dataset directly from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
3. **Load & Explore the Dataset**: Load the dataset into your environment and explore its contents to gain insights into the data.
4. **Perform Label Encoding**: Prepare the categorical variables by encoding them for machine learning algorithms.
5. **Split the data into Independent and Dependent sets and perform Feature Scaling**: Divide the dataset into features (independent variables) and target labels (dependent variable) and scale the features for better model performance.
6. **Building Logistic Regression Classifier**: Implement a logistic regression classifier to predict breast cancer outcomes based on the available features.
7. **Evaluate Performance of the Model**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics to assess its effectiveness in classifying tumors.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the tasks outlined in the project structure above, completing each one sequentially.
4. Refer to the provided code and instructions within each task for guidance.
5. Experiment with different approaches and parameters to improve the model's performance.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Kaggle API (for downloading datasets from Kaggle)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the project notebooks)
