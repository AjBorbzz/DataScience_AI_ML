# Phishing Email Detection using Transformer models and deep learning.

1. Asynchronously fetches emails from an IMAP email server.
2. Processes emails concurrently using an AI to detect phishing attempts.
3. Saves flagged phishing emails into a database or alerts the user.


### The role of the asyncio
- Email fetching via IMAP is I/O bound, so using `asyncio` allows us to check multiple emails **simultaneously**.
- The phishing detection model (example: a **Transformer**) can be loaded once and **used asynchronously**.
- This speeds up real-time phishing detection, making it **scalable** for enterprise use.

### Tech Stack:
- **asyncio + aioimaplib** -> Fetch emails asynchronously.
- **transformers (Hugging Face)** -> Use a pre-trained **BERT** model for phishing detection.
- **Sqlite3 or MongoDB** -> Store flagged phishing emails.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Install Dependencies
```shell
pip install aioimaplib aiohttp transformers torch 
```
2. Load Pre-Trained Phishing Detection Model
**BERT fine-tuned for phishing email detection.**
3. Asynchronously Connect to an email server (IMAP)
4. Process Emails Asynchronously with AI
5. Run Concurrently.

### :collision: Key Benefits of this Approach
:white_check_mark: **Asynchronous Fetching:** IMAP requests run concurrently, reducing wait times.
:white_check_mark: **Parallel Email Processing:** Multiple emails are analyzed **simultaneously**.
:white_check_mark: **Scalable for Enterprises:** Can be extended with logging, alerting, or a database.
:white_check_mark: **Integrates Deep Learning:** Uses `transformers` for accurate phishing detection.

### Next Steps (Enhancements)
1. Alert System
2. Database integration
3. Improve AI Model -> Fine-tune a Transformer model
4. Deploy in Production : Use FastAPI to expose an API for Phishing Detection.
