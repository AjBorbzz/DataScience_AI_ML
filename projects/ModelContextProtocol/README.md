# Model Context Protocol

In this notebook, I will explore the Model Context Protocol's components, use cases and application.

### What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) refers to a standardized method for passing contextual information to AI or machine learning models to guide or condition their behavior. While "Model Context Protocol" is not a widely established formal term in the same way as, say, HTTP or REST, it's increasingly used in modern AI platforms (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to describe how structured context—such as user identity, preferences, prior interactions, or system instructions—is embedded into model prompts or API requests.

### Use Cases:

#### Conversational AI / Chatbots
To carry memory across sessions, identify the user, and respond in a consistent tone or personality.

#### Security & Role-based Access Control
Provide context about user roles (admin vs. guest) so the model tailors outputs or restricts answers accordingly.

#### Multi-step Workflows
In tools like XSOAR or LangChain, context protocols allow models to "remember" the state of a task across several calls (e.g., incident triage with progressive inputs).

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
To pass metadata, sources, or prior retrieved documents as context for more accurate and grounded answers.

#### Personalization
Feeding in user preferences, past selections, or learning profiles to adapt responses dynamically.
