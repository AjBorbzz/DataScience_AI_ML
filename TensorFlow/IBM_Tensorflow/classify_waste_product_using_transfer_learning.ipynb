    "## Overview\n",
    "The city of GreenCity has been struggling with waste management, especially in distinguishing between recyclable and organic waste. The local waste management organization, EcoClean, is tasked with improving the efficiency of waste sorting. However, the current manual process is both time-consuming and error-prone. To enhance the system, EcoClean wants you to develop an AI-powered solution that can automatically classify waste products using image recognition techniques. This project aims to build a model that can differentiate between recyclable and organic waste products using transfer learning."

    "## Background\n",
    "EcoClean currently lacks an efficient and scalable method to automate the waste sorting process. The manual sorting of waste is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, leading to contamination of recyclable materials. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision to automate the classification of waste products, improving efficiency and reducing contamination rates. The project will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images."
