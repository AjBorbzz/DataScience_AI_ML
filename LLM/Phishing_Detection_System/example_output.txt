                ## Analysis\n\n
                ### Email Data Assessment\n
                - **Subject**: "Urgent: Your Account Has Been Locked!" uses urgency tactics common in phishing\n
                - **Sender**: Claims to be Chase Bank but uses a suspicious domain (chase-verification.com)\n
                - **Authentication**: All email authentication mechanisms failed (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n
                - **Content**: Brief message with urgent call to action and suspicious link\n
                - **URL**: Domain "chase-verification-login.com" is not an official Chase Bank domain\n\n
                ### IOC Enrichment\n
                - **Domain analysis**: "chase-verification.com" \n
                   - Not a legitimate Chase domain (legitimate would be chase.com)\n 
                 - Uses hyphenated domain naming pattern common in phishing\n
                 - **URL analysis**: "http://chase-verification-login.com"\n
                   - Uses HTTP instead of HTTPS (lacks encryption)\n  - Domain mimics Chase Bank but is not authentic\n
                   - Likely a credential harvesting page\n\n## Output\n\n
                 - **Verdict**: Phishing\n
                 - **Confidence**: 95%\n- **Reasoning**:\n
                   - Email fails all authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n
                   - Sender domain "chase-verification.com" is not an official Chase domain\n
                   - Uses classic phishing tactics: urgency, fear, and impersonation of a financial institution\n
                   - Contains suspicious URL that mimics the bank\'s name but on an unofficial domain\n
                   - Lacks specific customer information that would be in legitimate communications\n\n
                 - **IOC Enrichment**:\n
                   - chase-verification.com: Suspicious domain mimicking Chase Bank, not affiliated with legitimate financial institution\n
                   - chase-verification-login.com: Likely credential harvesting site, not an official Chase domain\n
                   - SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures: Indicates the email is not actually from the claimed sender\n\n
                 This is a clear phishing attempt designed to trick users into believing their Chase account has security issues requiring immediate action, with the goal of stealing login credentials.',
