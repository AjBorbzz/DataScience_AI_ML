The Bible also emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and mercy in our relationships with others, including those who may have borrowed from us.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Romans 8:11-15 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.\n* Proverbs 22:26-29 — Be thou not one of them that strike hands, [Or] of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?\n* Deuteronomy 24:6-10 — No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge.\n* Matthew 6:11-15 — Give us this day our daily bread.

Then his lord called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou besoughtest me: shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee?\n\nExplanation:\nScripture does not explicitly state that debt is a sin. However, it warns against entering into financial obligations without careful consideration and emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and mercy in our relationships with others.\n\nProverbs 22:26-29 cautions against becoming sureties for debts, highlighting the potential consequences of taking on too much financial responsibility. Deuteronomy 24:6-10 prohibits pledging one's life or property as collateral, emphasizing the importance of treating others fairly and not exploiting them through debt.\n\nMatthew 6:11-15 teaches us to forgive our debtors, just as we have been forgiven by God. John 8:31-35 emphasizes the importance of abiding in God's word and living according to His truth, which can help us make wise decisions about borrowing and lending.\n\nMatthew 18:31-35 provides a powerful illustration of the consequences of not forgiving others for their debts. Jesus' parable teaches that we should show mercy to others just as our heavenly Father has shown mercy to us.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Be cautious when entering into financial obligations, considering carefully whether you have the means to fulfill your commitments.\n* Prioritize forgiveness and mercy in your relationships with others, including those who may have borrowed from you.\n* Seek wisdom and guidance from God's word as you make decisions about borrowing and lending.\n* Remember that debt can be a serious issue, and it is important to treat others fairly and not exploit them through financial obligations."}

They change the night into day: The light, [say they], is near unto the darkness. If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness; If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, [Thou art] my mother, and my sister; Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?\"\n* Matthew 6:31-34 — \"Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\"\n\nExplanation:\nIn Job 17:11-15, Job laments about the uncertainty of life and the fleeting nature of human existence. He questions where his hope lies, implying that he has lost trust in God's provision. In contrast, Matthew 6:31-34 teaches us to prioritize seeking God's kingdom and righteousness above our physical needs. This passage reminds us that God knows our needs and will provide for them.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Practice trusting God's sovereignty by focusing on His character and promises rather than worrying about the future.\n* Prioritize seeking God's kingdom and righteousness, knowing that this will lead to His provision in your life.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to trust in Your sovereignty and provision.

It also reminds us that our labor is temporary and fleeting, and that we should not become too attached to it.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n- Psalms 26:11-12 — But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me. My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.\n- Job 27:1-5 — And Job again took up his parable, and said, As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul: (For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils); Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit. Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.\n- Psalms 26:1-5 — [[ A Psalm] of David]. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering. Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible emphasizes the importance of walking in integrity at work.

Instead, stand firm in your commitment to God's commands and principles.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to trust You without wavering, just as David did. May we walk in integrity at work, refusing to compromise our values or justify others. Guide us to bless Your name and seek Your guidance in all that we do. Amen."}
