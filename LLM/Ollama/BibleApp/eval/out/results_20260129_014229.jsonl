He did not let his circumstances dictate his emotions or actions; instead, he trusted in God's sovereignty and provision.

While many did not heed the glad tidings, God's word went out into all the earth, and His people were provoked to jealousy with a nation void of understanding. This emphasizes that forgiveness is not necessarily accompanied by reconciliation.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n(2 Timothy 4:11-15) When we are hurt or wronged, we can choose to forgive those who have caused harm, just as Paul did with Mark.

Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.\n\nExplanation:\n(1 Samuel 3:6-10) In this passage, we see that God is calling Samuel to obedience from the heart.

In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him; male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.\n\nExplanation:\n(Colossians 3:6-10) The Bible teaches us that our identity is not defined by our past successes or failures.

This shows that self-worth rooted in God comes from knowing and believing in Him.\n(Jeremiah 38:11-15) Jeremiah's faith was tested when he was asked to hide nothing from King Zedekiah. He knew that if he told the truth, he might be put to death.

Although he may have felt distant from God during this time, he continued to live a long life and see his family thrive.\n\n(Job 2:6-10) In this passage, Satan is given permission by God to test Job's faith. Despite being afflicted with painful boils, Job refuses to renounce God or sin with his lips.

Just as the glory of God is to conceal a thing, so too must we be cautious in seeking counsel from others. We must take away the dross (impurities) from the silver (counsel), and only then can we expect to receive a vessel for the refiner (wisdom). This process requires patience, diligence, and a willingness to listen.\n\n(Acts 1:11-15) The early church provides an example of seeking counsel wisely. After Jesus' ascension, the disciples returned to Jerusalem and devoted themselves to prayer, seeking guidance from God. They did not rush into action or seek counsel from just anyone; instead, they sought the Lord's direction through prayer.\n\nExplanation (continued):\n(Job 13:11-15) Furthermore, the Bible teaches that we must be willing to listen to God's voice, even when it is difficult or uncomfortable. Job's words serve as a reminder that seeking counsel wisely requires humility and a willingness to submit to God's will.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n1. Take time to pray and seek God's guidance before making important decisions.\n2. Be cautious in seeking counsel from others; take the time to discern whether their advice is wise or not.\n\n(Optional) Closing Prayer:\nDear Lord, help us to seek your guidance and wisdom in all our endeavors.

It encourages us to rest in Him and not fret about those who seem to be prospering or those who bring wicked devices to pass. (Job 36:1-5) Elihu's words remind us that God is mighty and despises not any, including those who seek His wisdom.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n- Practice patience and trust in God's timing, even when circumstances are unclear.\n- Seek wisdom from God rather than seeking to control or manipulate situations.\n\n(Optional) Closing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help me to wait patiently for Your direction, trusting that You will guide me according to Your perfect will.

Yet in this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God, who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.\n- 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 — Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.

Deuteronomy 32:46-50 serves as a reminder to set our hearts on God's words and commands, which will lead to a longer life in the land He has given us.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n1. When facing challenges or difficulties, remember that God is faithful and enduring, just like Israel experienced during their wilderness journey (Deuteronomy 1:31-35).\n2.

Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.\n- Matthew 10:1-5 — And he called unto him his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.\n\nExplanation:\n(2 Timothy 4:11-15) Paul's experience in ministry is a testament to the importance of perseverance in prayer and obedience to God's will. Despite facing challenges and delays, he remained faithful and continued to minister to others.\n(Matthew 10:1-5) Jesus gave his twelve disciples authority over unclean spirits and the power to heal all manner of diseases and sicknesses.

Help us to remain faithful and trusting in your sovereignty, even when faced with delay or challenge. May our faith be tested by delay, but may it not waver. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen."}
