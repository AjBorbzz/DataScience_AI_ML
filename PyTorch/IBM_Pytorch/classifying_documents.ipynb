    "## Project Introduction: Document Classification with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this personal project, I explore how machine learning can be used to automatically classify news articles into relevant categories. This kind of document classification is a key component of intelligent content search engines, helping users find information quickly and accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, I’ll use **PyTorch** and the **torchtext** library to preprocess and prepare raw text data for model training. The pipeline includes converting text into tensors, organizing it into batches, and building a classifier capable of predicting the topic of a given article.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the practical application of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning in organizing large volumes of unstructured text—a valuable capability for search, recommendation, and information retrieval systems.\n"
