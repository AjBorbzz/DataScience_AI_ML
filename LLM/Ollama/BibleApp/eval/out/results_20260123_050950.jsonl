What does the Bible say about managing money faithfully?", "allowed_refs": ["Isaiah 55:1-5", "Titus 3:6-10", "Hosea 12:6-10", "Luke 16:1-5", "2 Timothy 3:16-17", "Proverbs 22:16-20"], "found_refs": ["Isaiah 55:1-5", "Luke 16:1-5", "Isaiah 55:1-5", "Luke 16:1-5"], "invalid_refs": [], "citation_valid": 1, "format_valid": 1, "groundedness": 0.8571428571428571, "answer": "Biblical Summary:\nThe Bible teaches that God is our ultimate provider and that we should trust in Him for our financial needs. It also emphasizes the importance of being good stewards of our resources, using them wisely and not accumulating wealth at the expense of others.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Isaiah 55:1-5 — \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price... Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\"\n* Luke 16:1-5 — \"And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods... And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible teaches us that God is our ultimate provider, and we should trust in Him for our financial needs. Isaiah 55:1-5 reminds us that God offers spiritual nourishment without cost or condition, and that we should come to Him with an open heart and mind. Luke 16:1-5 tells the story of a steward who was accused of wasting his master's goods. The steward realized he couldn't continue in his role and began to make plans for his future, including seeking help from his lord's debtors.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Trust God as your ultimate provider, rather than relying on your paycheck.\n* Use your resources wisely, avoiding waste and excess.\n* Seek guidance from Scripture and prayer when making financial decisions.\n* Consider sharing your resources with others in need, rather than accumulating wealth at their expense.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Lord, we thank you for being our ultimate provider. Help us to trust in You and use our resources wisely. May we be good stewards of what you have given us, and may we seek Your guidance in all our financial decisions. Amen."}

What guidance does Scripture give about borrowing?", "allowed_refs": ["Romans 8:11-15", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10", "Matthew 6:11-15", "John 8:31-35", "Matthew 18:31-35"], "found_refs": ["Romans 8:11-15", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10", "Proverbs 22:26-29", "Deuteronomy 24:6-10"], "invalid_refs": [], "citation_valid": 1, "format_valid": 1, "groundedness": 0.8571428571428571, "answer": "Biblical Summary:\nScripture teaches that debt can be a serious issue and may even lead to spiritual consequences. The Bible provides guidance on borrowing and debt, emphasizing the importance of living responsibly and wisely with one's resources.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n\n* Romans 8:11-15 — But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.\n* Proverbs 22:26-29 — Be thou not one of them that strike hands, [Or] of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?\n* Deuteronomy 24:6-10 — No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh [a man's] life to pledge.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Bible warns against getting into debt and becoming a surety for someone else's debts. Proverbs 22:26-29 cautions against striking hands or becoming a guarantor for loans, as this can lead to financial ruin and even loss of one's bed (home). Deuteronomy 24:6-10 prohibits taking a millstone or upper millstone as collateral, recognizing that debt can be a life-threatening issue.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n\n* Be mindful of your financial situation and avoid getting into debt whenever possible.\n* Consider the potential consequences of borrowing and ensure you have a plan to repay any loans.\n* Prioritize living within your means and building up your resources rather than relying on debt.\n\nClosing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, we pray that You would guide us in our financial decisions and help us to live wisely with our resources. May we avoid the pitfalls of debt and instead build up our lives for Your glory. Amen."}

Here is a revised response that only uses the allowed references:\n\nBiblical Summary:\nForgiveness is a crucial aspect of Christian living, but it can be challenging to navigate when someone has betrayed us.\n\nKey Scriptures:\n- 2 Corinthians 2:6-10 — Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the many; so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.\n- Matthew 18:31-35 — So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.\n\nExplanation:\nIn 2 Corinthians 2:6-10, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of forgiveness in order to prevent someone who has sinned from being consumed by their own sorrow. Similarly, Jesus teaches us that our heavenly Father will treat us similarly if we do not forgive others (Matthew 18:31-35). This highlights the need for us to forgive those who have wronged us, even when it is difficult.\n\nWisdom Applications:\n- Practice self-reflection and prayer to work through your emotions and come to a place of forgiveness.\n- Recognize that holding onto bitterness and resentment can be harmful to yourself and others.\n\n(Optional) Closing Prayer:\nDear Heavenly Father, help me to forgive those who have wronged me, just as you have forgiven me. May I not hold onto bitterness and resentment, but instead choose to release them and trust in your goodness. Amen."}
